ValidatesAsEmail
================

This gem/plugin is a re-packaged and gem'ified version of the original plugin with credit as follows:

Donncha Redmond <dredmond@e-xact.com>

This Ruby on Rails plugin implements an ActiveRecord validation helper called
validates_as_email. The helper acts as if validates_format_of was used with a
regular expression that defines an RFC822 email address conformance test.

The plugin implements the regular expression here:

  http://tfletcher.com/lib/rfc822.rb

Which is an implementation in Ruby of a regular expression published by Cal
Henderson for PHP here:

  http://www.iamcal.com/publish/articles/php/parsing_email
